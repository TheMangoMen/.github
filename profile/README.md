# WatRank
Welcome to the WatRank GitHub Organization! We're building a platform that helps University of Waterloo students on their job search by crowdsourcing data that would benefit everyone to make informed decisions.

# Elevator Pitch

**TL;DR**: A more searchable, personalized WaterlooWorks megathread. Not a replacementâ€”but a companion. There are two main features:

## 1. During Interviews

### Problem:
Many people often ask, "Has anyone heard back from ___?" It's frustrating to be in the dark about whether a job has started giving out interviews, OAs (online assessments), and offer calls, or if they've already moved on with other candidates.  
- Some companies use WaterlooWorks' interview feature to update statuses, but many don't. The best option right now is to ask around in the megathread or through word of mouth.  
- There's no OA status on WaterlooWorks, and OAs are often the first step in the hiring pipeline. Additionally, there's no indication for companies that give offers via "offer calls."

### Solution:
A **crowdsourced job status table**.
- You can go to WatRank, bulk import the jobs you've applied to with just two keystrokes, and instantly see the contributions of others: their status updates for those companies.  
- When you contribute a job status, you can also add comments about how hard the interview was or the overall vibes, helping others gauge the process.  

### Flaws:
- **Trolls**: Like all crowdsourced data, it's only useful if enough people participate. However, we can moderate troll users since everyone logs in with their uWaterloo email.  
- **Accuracy**: It's not 100% accurate (neither is the megathread), but with enough contributions, the signal outweighs the noise.  

## 2. During Rankings

### Problem:
The most popular comment in the megathread is, "Is anyone taking ___?"  
- You want to maximize your rankings. If someone already accepted an offer for a job, there's no point in you ranking it highly.

### Solution:
Again, a **crowdsourced job status table**, but this time it's for **ranking statuses**.  
- For a job, you can see whether someone has accepted the offer or not.

### Flaws:
- **Bad actors**: We've considered how users might try to manipulate the system with false data. However, there are a few checks in place:
  - Each user (linked to their uWaterloo credentials) can only accept **one offer**. Since you can't rank more than one job as your #1 choice, this limits manipulation.  
  - Declining an offer is a different case, as you can receive multiple #1 rankings from employers, but we think this is less impactful because it doesn't significantly affect the ranking process.
